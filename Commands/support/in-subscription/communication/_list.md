# [Command] _support in-subscription communication list_

List all communications (attachments not included) for a support ticket. <br/></br> You can also filter support ticket communications by _CreatedDate_ or _CommunicationType_ using the $filter parameter. The only type of communication supported today is _Web_. Output will be a paged result with _nextLink_, using which you can retrieve the next set of Communication results. <br/><br/>Support ticket data is available for 18 months after ticket creation. If a ticket was created more than 18 months ago, a request for data might cause an error.
