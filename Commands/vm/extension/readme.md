# [Group] _vm extension_

Manage extensions on VMs.

Extensions are small applications that provide post-deployment configuration and automation tasks on Azure virtual machines. For example, if a virtual machine requires software installation, anti-virus protection, or Docker configuration, a VM extension can be used to complete these tasks. Extensions can be bundled with a new virtual machine deployment or run against any existing system.
